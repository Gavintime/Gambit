rule system
    white always moves first
    king moves 1 square in any direction
        a king is in check if an enemy piece is attacking the king (could capture it on the next turn)
            if the player whose king is in check cannot stop the king being taken, it is a checkmate
            the player cannot ever put their own king into check
        a king and rook may castle by having the king move 2 squares to one side, then having the rook of that side move to the square opposite it was before if
            it is the kings first move and the relevant rooks first move
            there cannot be any pieces between the king and the relevant rook
            the king must not be in check or pass through a square being attacked
    rook moves as far as it wants in any cardinal direction
    bishop moves as far as it wants in any subcardinal direction
    the queen has the moves of the rook and bishop
    knights move 2 squares in one direction, then 1 square 90 degrees (L shape) (can jump over other pieces, no other piece can)
    pawns can move 1 square forward or 2 squares if it is there first move
        pawns can only capture diagonally 1 square
        pawns must promote to a queen, knight, rook, or bishop once reaching the end of the board
        if a pawn moves forward 2 squares and become adjacent to the enemies pawn, the enemy pawn can en passant by capturing the pawn and placing itself behind the pawn location, this must be done immediately after the pawn moves forward 2 squares
    a draw occurs if
        a player has no legal moves to play but the king is not in check (stalemate)
        the combinations of pieces on the board makes it impossible for either player to checkmate
            (king v king, king and bishop v king, king and knight v king, king and bishop versus king and bishop with both bishops on same color square)
        the same board position happens 3 times (player must claim draw, not automatic) (all pieces same squares, same player has the move, same castling rights, en passant possibility is the same)
            does not need to happen in succession
        the same board position happens 5 times (same as above rule but is automatic, no claim needed)
        there has been no capture or pawn movement in the last 50 or 75 moves
